/**
 * An implementation of X509KeyManager backed by a KeyStore.
 *
 * The backing KeyStore is inspected when this object is constructed.
 * All key entries containing a PrivateKey and a non-empty chain of
 * X509Certificate are then copied into an internal store. This means
 * that subsequent modifications of the KeyStore have no effect on the
 * X509KeyManagerImpl object.
 *
 * Note that this class assumes that all keys are protected by the same
 * password.
 *
 * The JSSE handshake code currently calls into this class via
 * chooseClientAlias() and chooseServerAlias() to find the certificates to
 * use. As implemented here, both always return the first alias returned by
 * getClientAliases() and getServerAliases(). In turn, these methods are
 * implemented by calling getAliases(), which performs the actual lookup.
 *
 * Note that this class currently implements no checking of the local
 * certificates. In particular, it is *not* guaranteed that:
 *  . the certificates are within their validity period and not revoked
 *  . the signatures verify
 *  . they form a PKIX compliant chain.
 *  . the certificate extensions allow the certificate to be used for
 *    the desired purpose.
 *
 * Chains that fail any of these criteria will probably be rejected by
 * the remote peer.
