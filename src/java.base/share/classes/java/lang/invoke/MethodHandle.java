/**
 * A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
 * constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
 * transformations of arguments or return values.
 * These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as
 * {@linkplain #asType conversion},
 * {@linkplain #bindTo insertion},
 * {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#dropArguments deletion},
 * and {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#filterArguments substitution}.
 *
 * <h2>Method handle contents</h2>
 * Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
 * They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
 * A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
 * the method handle's own {@linkplain #type() type descriptor}.
 * <p>
 * Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the {@link #type() type} accessor.
 * This type descriptor is a {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType MethodType} object,
 * whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
 * the return type of the method (or {@code void.class} if none).
 * <p>
 * A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
 * and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.
 * <p>
 * A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
 * called {@link #invokeExact invokeExact} and {@link #invoke invoke}.
 * Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
 * underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
 * as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
 * Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
 * The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.
 * <p>
 * Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
 * Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
 * With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
 * as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables.  This means that any method
 * handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
 * This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
 * variable in a data race.
 * <p>
 * Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
 * Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of {@code MethodHandle}
 * which may be visible via the {@link java.lang.Object#getClass Object.getClass}
 * operation.  The programmer should not draw conclusions about a method handle
 * from its specific class, as the method handle class hierarchy (if any)
 * may change from time to time or across implementations from different vendors.
 *
 * <h2>Method handle compilation</h2>
 * A Java method call expression naming {@code invokeExact} or {@code invoke}
 * can invoke a method handle from Java source code.
 * From the viewpoint of source code, these methods can take any arguments
 * and their result can be cast to any return type.
 * Formally this is accomplished by giving the invoker methods
 * {@code Object} return types and variable arity {@code Object} arguments,
 * but they have an additional quality called <em>signature polymorphism</em>
 * which connects this freedom of invocation directly to the JVM execution stack.
 * <p>
 * As is usual with virtual methods, source-level calls to {@code invokeExact}
 * and {@code invoke} compile to an {@code invokevirtual} instruction.
 * More unusually, the compiler must record the actual argument types,
 * and may not perform method invocation conversions on the arguments.
 * Instead, it must generate instructions that push them on the stack according
 * to their own unconverted types.  The method handle object itself is pushed on
 * the stack before the arguments.
 * The compiler then generates an {@code invokevirtual} instruction that invokes
 * the method handle with a symbolic type descriptor which describes the argument
 * and return types.
 * <p>
 * To issue a complete symbolic type descriptor, the compiler must also determine
 * the return type.  This is based on a cast on the method invocation expression,
 * if there is one, or else {@code Object} if the invocation is an expression,
 * or else {@code void} if the invocation is a statement.
 * The cast may be to a primitive type (but not {@code void}).
 * <p>
 * As a corner case, an uncasted {@code null} argument is given
 * a symbolic type descriptor of {@code java.lang.Void}.
 * The ambiguity with the type {@code Void} is harmless, since there are no references of type
 * {@code Void} except the null reference.
 *
 * <h2>Method handle invocation</h2>
 * The first time an {@code invokevirtual} instruction is executed
 * it is linked by symbolically resolving the names in the instruction
 * and verifying that the method call is statically legal.
 * This also holds for calls to {@code invokeExact} and {@code invoke}.
 * In this case, the symbolic type descriptor emitted by the compiler is checked for
 * correct syntax, and names it contains are resolved.
 * Thus, an {@code invokevirtual} instruction which invokes
 * a method handle will always link, as long
 * as the symbolic type descriptor is syntactically well-formed
 * and the types exist.
 * <p>
 * When the {@code invokevirtual} is executed after linking,
 * the receiving method handle's type is first checked by the JVM
 * to ensure that it matches the symbolic type descriptor.
 * If the type match fails, it means that the method which the
 * caller is invoking is not present on the individual
 * method handle being invoked.
 * <p>
 * In the case of {@code invokeExact}, the type descriptor of the invocation
 * (after resolving symbolic type names) must exactly match the method type
 * of the receiving method handle.
 * In the case of plain, inexact {@code invoke}, the resolved type descriptor
 * must be a valid argument to the receiver's {@link #asType asType} method.
 * Thus, plain {@code invoke} is more permissive than {@code invokeExact}.
 * <p>
 * After type matching, a call to {@code invokeExact} directly
 * and immediately invoke the method handle's underlying method
 * (or other behavior, as the case may be).
 * <p>
 * A call to plain {@code invoke} works the same as a call to
 * {@code invokeExact}, if the symbolic type descriptor specified by the caller
 * exactly matches the method handle's own type.
 * If there is a type mismatch, {@code invoke} attempts
 * to adjust the type of the receiving method handle,
 * as if by a call to {@link #asType asType},
 * to obtain an exactly invokable method handle {@code M2}.
 * This allows a more powerful negotiation of method type
 * between caller and callee.
 * <p>
 * (<em>Note:</em> The adjusted method handle {@code M2} is not directly observable,
 * and implementations are therefore not required to materialize it.)
 *
 * <h2>Invocation checking</h2>
 * In typical programs, method handle type matching will usually succeed.
 * But if a match fails, the JVM will throw a {@link WrongMethodTypeException},
 * either directly (in the case of {@code invokeExact}) or indirectly as if
 * by a failed call to {@code asType} (in the case of {@code invoke}).
 * <p>
 * Thus, a method type mismatch which might show up as a linkage error
 * in a statically typed program can show up as
 * a dynamic {@code WrongMethodTypeException}
 * in a program which uses method handles.
 * <p>
 * Because method types contain "live" {@code Class} objects,
 * method type matching takes into account both type names and class loaders.
 * Thus, even if a method handle {@code M} is created in one
 * class loader {@code L1} and used in another {@code L2},
 * method handle calls are type-safe, because the caller's symbolic type
 * descriptor, as resolved in {@code L2},
 * is matched against the original callee method's symbolic type descriptor,
 * as resolved in {@code L1}.
 * The resolution in {@code L1} happens when {@code M} is created
 * and its type is assigned, while the resolution in {@code L2} happens
 * when the {@code invokevirtual} instruction is linked.
 * <p>
 * Apart from type descriptor checks,
 * a method handle's capability to call its underlying method is unrestricted.
 * If a method handle is formed on a non-public method by a class
 * that has access to that method, the resulting handle can be used
 * in any place by any caller who receives a reference to it.
 * <p>
 * Unlike with the Core Reflection API, where access is checked every time
 * a reflective method is invoked,
 * method handle access checking is performed
 * <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#access">when the method handle is created</a>.
 * In the case of {@code ldc} (see below), access checking is performed as part of linking
 * the constant pool entry underlying the constant method handle.
 * <p>
 * Thus, handles to non-public methods, or to methods in non-public classes,
 * should generally be kept secret.
 * They should not be passed to untrusted code unless their use from
 * the untrusted code would be harmless.
 *
 * <h2>Method handle creation</h2>
 * Java code can create a method handle that directly accesses
 * any method, constructor, or field that is accessible to that code.
 * This is done via a reflective, capability-based API called
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup MethodHandles.Lookup}.
 * For example, a static method handle can be obtained
 * from {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#findStatic Lookup.findStatic}.
 * There are also conversion methods from Core Reflection API objects,
 * such as {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#unreflect Lookup.unreflect}.
 * <p>
 * Like classes and strings, method handles that correspond to accessible
 * fields, methods, and constructors can also be represented directly
 * in a class file's constant pool as constants to be loaded by {@code ldc} bytecodes.
 * A new type of constant pool entry, {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle},
 * refers directly to an associated {@code CONSTANT_Methodref},
 * {@code CONSTANT_InterfaceMethodref}, or {@code CONSTANT_Fieldref}
 * constant pool entry.

 * 4.4.8} an
