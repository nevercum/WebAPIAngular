/**
 * A method handle is a typed, directly executable reference to an underlying method,
 * constructor, field, or similar low-level operation, with optional
 * transformations of arguments or return values.
 * These transformations are quite general, and include such patterns as
 * {@linkplain #asType conversion},
 * {@linkplain #bindTo insertion},
 * {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#dropArguments deletion},
 * and {@linkplain java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#filterArguments substitution}.
 *
 * <h2>Method handle contents</h2>
 * Method handles are dynamically and strongly typed according to their parameter and return types.
 * They are not distinguished by the name or the defining class of their underlying methods.
 * A method handle must be invoked using a symbolic type descriptor which matches
 * the method handle's own {@linkplain #type() type descriptor}.
 * <p>
 * Every method handle reports its type descriptor via the {@link #type() type} accessor.
 * This type descriptor is a {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodType MethodType} object,
 * whose structure is a series of classes, one of which is
 * the return type of the method (or {@code void.class} if none).
 * <p>
 * A method handle's type controls the types of invocations it accepts,
 * and the kinds of transformations that apply to it.
 * <p>
 * A method handle contains a pair of special invoker methods
 * called {@link #invokeExact invokeExact} and {@link #invoke invoke}.
 * Both invoker methods provide direct access to the method handle's
 * underlying method, constructor, field, or other operation,
 * as modified by transformations of arguments and return values.
 * Both invokers accept calls which exactly match the method handle's own type.
 * The plain, inexact invoker also accepts a range of other call types.
 * <p>
 * Method handles are immutable and have no visible state.
 * Of course, they can be bound to underlying methods or data which exhibit state.
 * With respect to the Java Memory Model, any method handle will behave
 * as if all of its (internal) fields are final variables.  This means that any method
 * handle made visible to the application will always be fully formed.
 * This is true even if the method handle is published through a shared
 * variable in a data race.
 * <p>
 * Method handles cannot be subclassed by the user.
 * Implementations may (or may not) create internal subclasses of {@code MethodHandle}
 * which may be visible via the {@link java.lang.Object#getClass Object.getClass}
 * operation.  The programmer should not draw conclusions about a
