<!--

These are the grammatical features that are used in each locale to mark inflected forms of nouns.

CLDR textual items may be tagged with grammatical features when these are needed to ensure that the
correct forms are used in context.

For instance, in Russian "Уменьши яркость света до 33 процентов" ("dim the light to 33 percent"),
the 'percent' unit must be expressed in plural and in the genitive case, whereas "1%" would be
expressed in different cases depending on the context. The case usage is implicit in short form
"33%", but the full form requires the grammatical variant marked by case and number to be expressed
correctly.

In romance languages, nouns such as unit names have an intrinsic grammatical gender, which
propagates by agreement to other parts of sentence. For example, in French "2 jours sont passés"
("two days have gone by") expresses the participle "passés" in the plural masculine form, whereas
"2 heures sont passées" requires the participle in the plural feminine form to agree with the
grammatical gender of the unit "h", even when short forms are used.

Note that plural status is not included here: CLDR handles plurals with special categories in
plurals.xml and ordinals.xml. See those files and the LDML spec for more information.
